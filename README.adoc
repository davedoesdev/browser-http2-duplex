:prewrap!:

== The problem

The https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html[HTTP/2 spec] supports full-duplex
streams between client and server. Accordingly, if you use the Node.js
https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/http2.html[`http2`] module on
client and server, you get a https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex[`Duplex`] stream on both sides.

However, you won't get a full-duplex stream in a browser client.

The https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/[Fetch] API specification does provide for
duplex streams:

* You can https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#body-mixin[specify a ReadableStream] when making a request (here's the https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/425[PR] which added it to the spec).

* You can call `getReader` on https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-body[response bodies] to get a
https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#rs-class[`ReadableStream`].

The latter works fine in browsers -- you can read data sent from the server
using the `ReadableStream` class.

But streaming data from the browser to the server using Fetch doesn't work:

1. Browsers don't implement attaching a `ReadableStream` to a request body yet. Chromium has started to implement it https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=688906[here].

2. Even when attaching a `ReadableStream` to a request body has been implemented, you won't get full-duplex behaviour according to
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=688906#c40[this comment]
from the Chromium team:

> It won't be full-duplex. You'll have to send everything before receiving anything (anything sent by the server before that will be buffered).

== Solution

`browser-http2-duplex` emulates a full-duplex Node.js `Duplex` stream in the
browser over HTTP/2 using the Fetch API.

* Each data chunk your application writes to the `Duplex` is sent to the server
in a _separate_ POST request (over a single HTTP/2 connection).

* Data from the initial response body's `ReadableStream` is pushed to the
`Duplex` for your application to read.

On the server, `browser-http2-duplex` marries up the separate POST requests with
the initial reponse and presents a `Duplex` stream to your application.

== Example

Here's a server which echoes data it receives on a duplex stream back to
clients.

[source,javascript]
.server.js
----
import fs from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';
import { createSecureServer } from 'http2';
import { Http2DuplexServer } from 'http2-duplex';
const { readFile } = fs.promises;
const cert_dir = join(__dirname, 'certs');

(async function () {
    const http2_server = createSecureServer({ // <1>
        key: await readFile(join(cert_dir, 'server.key')),
        cert: await readFile(join(cert_dir, 'server.crt'))
    });

    const http2_duplex_server = new Http2DuplexServer( // <2>
        http2_server,
        '/example'
    );

    http2_duplex_server.on('duplex', function (stream) { <3>
        stream.pipe(stream);
    });

    http2_duplex_server.on('unhandled_stream', function (stream, headers) { <4>
        const path = headers[':path'];
        if (path === '/client.html') {
            return stream.respondWithFile(
                join(__dirname, path.substr(1)),
                { 'content-type': 'text/html' });
        }
        if ((path === '/client.js') ||
            (path === '/bundle.js')) {
            return stream.respondWithFile(
                join(__dirname, path.substr(1)),
                { 'content-type': 'text/javascript' });
        }
        stream.respond({ ':status': 404 }, { endStream: true });
    });

    http2_server.listen(7000, () =>
        console.log('Please visit https://localhost:7000/client.html'));
})();
----
<1> Create a standard Node.js HTTP/2 server.
<2> Create a server to communicate with clients using full-duplex emulation.
<3> When a client creates a new duplex, the server gets a `duplex` event.
<4> Other requests raise an `unhandled_stream` event. Here we return the client
files to the browser.

Note you can just Control-C the server to stop it. If you wanted to stop the
server in code, you would do something like this:

[source,javascript]
----
http2_duplex_server.detach(); <1>
await promisify(http2_server.close.bind(http2_server))();
----
<1> This destroys all active sessions.

Here's a client which sends keypresses to the server and writes the echoed
response to the page:

[source,javascript]
.client.js
----
export default async function () {
    const duplex = await http2_client_duplex_bundle.make( <1>
        'https://localhost:7000/example');
    
    document.addEventListener('keypress', ev => { <2>
        duplex.write(ev.key);
    });

    duplex.on('readable', function () { <3>
        let buf;
        do {
            buf = this.read();
            if (buf !== null) {
                document.body.appendChild(document.createTextNode(buf.toString()));
            }
        } while (buf !== null);
    });
}
----
<1> Connect to the server and emulate a new full-duplex stream.
<2> When the user presses a key, write the character to the stream.
<3> Read characters the server echoes back from the stream and append them to
the document body.

That's a simple example of setting up duplex emulation between a browser and a
server. You'll also need an HTML page and to bundle up the client-side library
(e.g. using Webpack). You can find all these files in the link:example[]
directory. To run the example:

[source,bash]
----
grunt --gruntfile Gruntfile.cjs example
----

and then point your browser to https://localhost:7000/client.html.
